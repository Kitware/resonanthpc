# ResonantHPC

ResonantHPC is designed to increase scientific productivity by providing HPC
capable pre-and-post processing for easier and faster turnaround and
integration with modern and next-generation simulation systems.
This system will extend the standard scientific computing environment
(Jupyter) so that researchers can prepare, execute, and analyze the results
of remote exascale-level simulation from their workstations.

ResonantHPC will:
* provide a data integration module that enables pulling data from
  heterogeneous sources as well as running required preprocessing.
* include a modeling interface that enables the user to generate
  an input mesh (through the execution of an external mesher) and
  to associate additional attributes to mesh elements.
* enable, through a simple user interface, the execution
  and monitoring of HPC jobs such as preprocessing, simulation and
  visualization modules.
* incorporate a leading parallel analysis and visualization module.
* run inside a web browser and provide both user interface and
  scripting access to its functionality.
