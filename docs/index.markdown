# About Section
# include located in /_includes/home-about.html
about-heading: HPC-Enabled Pre- and Post-Processing with Jupyter
about-text: ResonantHPC is designed to increase scientific productivity by providing HPC capable pre-and-post processing for easier and faster turnaround and integration with modern and next-generation simulation systems. This system will extend the standard scientific computing environment (Jupyter) so that researchers can prepare, execute, and analyze the results of remote exascale-level simulation from their workstations.

about-features:
  - name: Data Integration
    description: Provide a data integration module that enables pulling data from heterogeneous sources as well as running required preprocessing.
